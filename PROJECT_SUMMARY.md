## Installation Notes

Successfully resolved Box2D installation on Windows:
- Use `Box2D` (capital B and D) package
- Version 2.3.10 has precompiled wheels for Python 3.11
- Also requires `pygame`

## Next Steps

### 1. Training
```bash
python train.py
```

Training will run for 1,000,000 timesteps (~4-8 hours on GPU).

### 2. Monitor Progress
- Logs saved in `logs/`
- Checkpoints saved in `checkpoints/`
- Best model saved based on evaluation performance

### 3. Evaluation
```bash
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt
```

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Modify `config/ppo_config.py`:
- Adjust learning rate
- Change network architecture
- Tune PPO parameters
- Modify training duration

### 5. Experiments
Use the Jupyter notebook for:
- Visualizing training curves
- Analyzing performance
- Comparing different configurations
